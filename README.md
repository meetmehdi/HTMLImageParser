# HTMLImageParser

My motivation for this sample project is that normally what we do is that if we need to show HTML we use web view which have some drawbacks. 

Now we don't need to use webview!!!

In this sample project I am parsing html and image tag, than extracting the image from image url. Image is downloaded and is displayed.
